            <p>
              I'm interested in a multitude of things outside of coding, but the main one is stand-up comedy. I listen to stand-up like most people listen to music. My all-time favorite comedian is Doug Stanhope. He's not very well-known, but his fellow comics consider him one of the greatest. I also like Louis CK, Bill Burr, Anthony Jeselnik, George Carlin, and many more. My biggest dream in life is to become a professional comedian, so I spend most of my free time pursuing that goal.

              Another one of my main interests is film. I really enjoy the technical side of filmmaking, mainly post-production, and I've had a few freelance gigs as a motion graphics artist and video editor. Once I have a job as a programmer, all of my extra money is going to go towards film equipment so I can start bringing some of my ideas to life again.

            <p>
              I became interested in computer programming after taking an MBTI personality test. My personality type is INTP, and I found that programming was one of the most popular careers for INTPs. I was already on the computer all the time, so I figured I may as well learn how to put that time to good use.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, I began doing coding tutorials at home, which was thoroughly challenging and enjoyable. I decided that I would like to do it for a career, and the fast-paced environment of Epicodus was very intriguing. Rather than go to college for four years, I decided I'd rather work dilegently at Epicodus for five months and go straight into the workforce. Hopefully, it all pays off!
